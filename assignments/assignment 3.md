Overview

Prototypes are a great way to test out new ideas and demonstrate how a product will work before getting deep into development.

You will be researching similar products and creating a prototype of your app for Project and Portfolio IV. This is done in order to have most of the UI design done before jumping into development, and also to get valuable feedback from your course director and classmates, in case something needs to be re-worked or re-factored.

Preparation

Research products similar to our project. Note how those products have made smart UX decisions. Note features that are missing from these similar products that we believe would make for a better UX in our project/product.

Create a GUI feature list. This list will include features we are borrowing/copying from the similar products researched in our pitches, and original features that we noted are missing from those similar products. Give details on each of the features, what needs will they meet for our user. Think back to the greenlighted pitch, the similar products mentioned in it, apply that level of detail to our features.

Create (or gather) the necessary assets to put together your prototype.

Pick a tool to build the interface of the product/project. There are a number of tools you can use to help put your prototype together.

Try these free options:

https://www.figma.com/
https://proto.io/
https://miro.com/
https://balsamiq.com/
https://marvelapp.com/



I highly recommend Figma as the tool to use. Here are series of guides on how to produce an interactive prototype using Figma. I suggest starting with Guide to prototyping in Figma;

The Prototype

Take what has been learned in the research preparation done above of other products/apps/websites, and create a rapid prototype using your prototyping tool. This prototype needs to include every single interaction in the list of features. Focus first on the primary interactions the user will make with the application, as well as the basic flow of the application. After the primary interactions are in place, implement all remaining features/interactions the app with provide. Graphics and iconography do not need to be finalized, but should be a somewhat fair indication of how the final app will appear.

All projects are different, so the amount of interactions/features the prototype will support is variable.

Submissions

A (.pdf) document that notes which similar products were researched, what parts our interface will borrow from those products, and where our product will improve upon poor interface choices.
Also list the prioritized features the product/project will have, and the ones the prototype can accomplish currently.
The prototyping tool used must offer a URL to share the interface via the web. Provide a shareable link as a message in the documentation of this assignment.
The prototype app must be able to play/run/launch from the URL provided.
Here is a Figma guide on how to share via URL.
PLEASE NOTE; do not zip up and submit the interface.

Documentation discloses a list of all features/functionality, and a link to the digital Prototype
Documentation discloses a list of some features/functionality, and a link to the digital Prototype
Documentation discloses a link to the digital Prototype without any research done
Not attempted
Exemplary
Research of similar products is done and noted in the assignment Documentation.

Disclosed in the Documentation are all primary/secondary/tertiary features/functionality the final version of our product/project will have implemented.

For each feature in the feature list of the product/project;

An explanation of what the feature/functionality will provide the user
The priority of the feature/functionality is given
Is this features borrowed from a similar product, or is this completely new feature
Why the feature is needed for this product is provided
A link to the Prototype interface is provided in the Documentation.

Interaction

A digital prototyping tool is used to build a interactive mockup of the final version of the PP4 project/product. This mockup represent the entire interface planned so far.

DETAILS
N/A
A digital prototyping tool is used to build a interactive mockup of the PP4 project/product. This mockup represent the entire interface planned so far.
N/A
A digital prototyping tool is used to build a mockup of the PP4 project/product. This mockup is a series of static images that provides no interaction or state change feedback.
Not attempted
Exemplary
All The primary/secondary/tertiary features of the application, disclosed in the Documentation or newly discovered, are present in the digital Prototype.

The user can interact with the features changing the state of the digital Prototype. 

Using the Prototype the user can accomplish tasks in a similar manner to how they would in the final version of the PP4 project/product.

UI/UX
33% weight
The Prototype's interface showcases research done on how to give the user a great User Experience, and that research is implemented throughout the entire Prototype. Platform and appearance consideration are present.

DETAILS
User Experience considerations for only the primary and secondary features are documented in the research, and implemented in the Prototype. Platform and appearance consideration present but minimal.
User Experience considerations for only the primary features are documented in the research, and implemented in the Prototype. Platform considerations are also absent.
Some User Experience considerations are implemented in the prototype without any research to backup choices. Platform considerations are also absent.
No User Experience considerations are implemented in the prototype.
Not attempted
Exemplary
Layout and flow of the Prototype have a well thought-out User Experience based on research done on similar products in the Documentation.

Layout and flow of Prototype is consistent with the platform the PP4 project will be developed for.

QoL considerations for the user are present throughout the Prototype. Every input from the user and output to the interface are considered. Feedback on the app current state is required.

The Prototype's appearance comes as close as possible to the final app's intended appearance. (no placeholder text, etc.)
