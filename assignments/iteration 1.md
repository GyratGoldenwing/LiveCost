Overview

This “proof of concept” is in place to ensure that the app you have planned for Project and Portfolio IV is feasible. Additionally, you will be starting your Github repository, as well as setting up the complete roadmap for the project using Trello.

Preparation

Make sure that you have the necessary development tools for the project. This may be an IDE (such as Android Studio, Visual Studio, or Video Studio Code), as well as any other dependencies you might need. Database connections, APIs, sensors, whatever your project will need must be in place for this assignment.

To test that everything is working, create an empty project or use the project from the R&D assignment and trim out any useless code modules.

Proof of Concept

Once you have a working project, demonstrate that you are able to use the technologies that you have chosen. This will differ for each project, but examples would be showing off use of an API to retrieve information or using the camera to take and save a photo. Work done in the R&D project is a good place to start.

Since this will be the foundation for your next portfolio piece, feel free to put in as much work as you can at this point.

GitHub

After you have a “proof of concept” that shows off your platform and technologies, create and submit it to a GitHub repository. Once that is complete please invite your Course Director to the repository. My username there is CreatorRob.

Trello

Additionally, create a roadmap for the project using Trello. Create a Trello account if you do not have one already. In Trello create a workspace for your project. Invite you Course Director to that Workspace. My username there is creatorrob. Then in the Workspace create a board to serve as a development roadmap keep track of what you will need to do on the project over the coming month. Every bit of documentation should reside or be referenceable in the board(s) of this Workspace.

The Video

Record a short 3-5 minute video, showing off the capabilities of your app. Talk about what you have done so far, and what you have planned for the full version. Make sure to demonstrate the actual application, as well as talking through some of your code.

App demonstration
Show off the progress made on your app during the week. Explain how it works from a user's perspective
Code review
Show off some of the code written during the week. Explain how it works from a developer's perspective.
DO NOT JUST READ THE CODE!
Trello
The entire board is confirmed updated
Any new cards are noted
Any changes to existing cards are noted
GitHub
Confirmation that at least 3 days of pushes are made
Self-Reflection (Answer the following questions)
What do you want to continue doing that worked well?
What do you want to stop doing that is slowing/stopping production?
What do you want to start doing that you think would improve production?
What went right, and why?
What went wrong, and why?
How can you use your experience this week to make your future development smoother?
