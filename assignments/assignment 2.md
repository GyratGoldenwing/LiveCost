Assignment 2 - Technical Research & Development Project
OVERVIEW

COMPLETION

Overview

Research is essential for learning new information and techniques. As a developer, you will constantly be looking at new tools and investigating new languages and techniques to determine what is the best fit for a given project.

The Context

We are a small studio that has an opportunity to get out in front of a new market. This research app and doc will inform the rest of the team of the specific tech being researched, what was learned during the research will inform the rest of the team about the tech. The knowledge gained during the research must be more than what somebody could gain doing a Google search. Do not waste the studio's limited resources by giving us anything but useful information. Explain what was learned; What solutions does the tech offer? Why this option over any other option? What to look out for? Meet with your Director if you are unclear on what is a isn't useful information.



Preparation

Formulate two Feature Lists;

-A list of all planned features the final version of the PP4 project will contain. This is the PP4 feature list.

-A list of features that prove the various components of the technology stack will work together interdependently. This is the R&D feature list.



The PP4 feature list should be easy, it's anything and everything that the final version of the project. All needs/wants/desires in an ordered list. All project details from assignment 4 must be present.

The R&D feature list is often times far harder to build. This is normal. Each project has different technology stacks, so a one size fits all approach won't work here. Focus this list to consider what the user's goals are when coming to this app. Review the PP4 feature list, boil down the essence of each of those features into the technical requirements needed to represent them;

-UI. Users need to input and get feedback from the UI. Represent all activities, views, controls, labels, input fields, and components users need to accomplish goals.

-Data. Storing, modifying, linking, deleting data needs to happen, either locally or remotely. Represent all data sources, data/file structuring, and I/O.

-Hardware. Integrate platform specific hardware functionality.

Submit both lists of features to this assignment before the application is started.

Ask any questions on this topic promptly, there is no time to delay.



The Application

Using the R&D feature list mentioned above create an application in the platform you plan to develop your project in. The application needs to incorporates the entire technology chain, all the API(s), sensor(s), databases; anything and everything stated in the greenlighted pitch, and anything new that has been discovered to be needed for the final version of this product/project.

Demonstrate an understanding of how to work with the tech by incorporating user-driven interaction(s) with the technology through the application's interface.



NOTE: Focus only on meaningful interactions. Login screens, settings menus, and dark mode are not unique or meaningful to this software. Do not focus on them.



The Document

During the research and development of the application report what was learned. Talk about the triumphs, the roadblocks, and the lessons learned. Include in the document both of the Feature Lists.
Evaluate whether the technology and the pitch are going to work together, what obstacles may arise during the production cycle of the product, ways to mitigate those risks, and boundaries of the tech(what is and isn't possible).


BE ADVISED: This will be a technical document, and not a historical summary of your topic. Do not use I and we statements. This doc will explain the why of and the need for this piece of tech, dig deep on the benefits of going this route, what parts will be used, thoughts on the project that occurred during the research and development, and details of the hands on experience with the technology.

Research paper is at least two pages in length, and use at least three sources. Example sources would be articles that cover limitations/boundaries of the technology, known issues that this project will have to deal with or overcome, or documentation that was used to solve problems that arose during development of the research application. Make sure these sources are cited within the text, and listed in a “References” section at the end of the paper using APA formatting.

NOTE: Document every AI prompt in the References section.



The Video

Record a review of the functionality built in the application. Share what was actually built and compare that to what the planned functionality was in the Feature List. Review the codebase and explain the modules of logic. Teach what changes/pivots had to be made during the research & development process over the week, and why.

Cover a retrospective of the development and research cycle. What went right that you plan to continue doing. What went wrong that you would like to stop doing, along with steps on how you plan to make that a reality. Things you want to start doing that would benefit the project in the future.

Submission

An .mp4 uploaded, presenting the entire application's current level of functionality, along with a review of the codebase.
A technical research & development document that goes over the technology as a whole and also details what was learned in the research and development of the application. Submit in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format. Naming convention must be as follows: LastName_FirstName_Week#_AssignmentName

Video and document are submitted to FSO directly to this assignment via the Feedback section.
